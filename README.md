# Amazon-price-tracker

###  This is python automation script which scrapes through the amazon website. Checks if the price of specified product is deceased or not and sends a message to the whatsapp number about the price of product. 
### Here I used beautifulsoup(bs4) library for parsing HTML data, requests for sending HTTP requests. Twilio API is used to the product prices via send whatsapp messages.

## Dependecies installation
### `pip install requests`
### `pip install bs4`
### `pip install twilio`
